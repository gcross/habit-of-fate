|Susie is starting to feel like he/she| will never make it back when he/she|
notices that things are starting to get brighter -- he/she| must be getting close
to the vilage! he/she| gives you thanks for guiding her home.

A little bit further, and he/she| is back to his/her| house. Without a moment to
spare, he/she| immediately starts brewing medicine for |Tommy! He/she| brings
the medicine to |Tommy, and wakes him/her|Tommy up long enough to ladel it down
his throat. He/she|Tommy immediately falls back asleep. As |Susie is filled with
relief, exhaustion catches up to him/her| and he/she| falls asleep on the floor.

He/she| sleeps peacefully, with a smile on his/her| face. The next day, he/she|
builds an alter to you out of gratitude.
