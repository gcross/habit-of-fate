The last thing in the world that <strong>|Susie</strong> wanted to do was
to wander alone in the Wicked Forest at night, but his/her|Susie
son/daughter|Tommy, little <strong>|Tommy</strong>, was sick and would not
live through the night unless |Susie could find <strong>an
|Illsbane</strong> plant. It is a hopeless task, but he/she| has no
other choice.
