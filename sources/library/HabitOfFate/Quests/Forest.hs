  [[s_fixed|
|Susie sees a house made out of... gingerbread?

He/she| feels a strange compulsion to approach it.
================================================================================
He/she| fights the compulsion, and continues on his/her| search.
================================================================================
As he/she| gets closer, the door opens and an old woman beckons her in.
“You've arrived just in time!” she says. “Dinner has just finished cooking. Come
on in!”

Not knowing why he/she| was doing this, |Susie entered the... cottage? The woman
leads her to an oven. “Here, look inside.”

|Susie looks inside the oven and sees... little |Tommy? he/she| screams, and
faints.

Daylight awakens her. He/she|Susie looks around, but the gingerbread house is
nowhere to be found.

He/she| sobs -- there is no way that he/she| will be able to make it home
in time now.

Nothing happens as |Susie wanders through the forest.
================================================================================
As |Susie continues to search he/she| hears the howling of wolves, which makes
him/her| shiver. Thank goodness they seem to be in the distance!
================================================================================
|Susie is paying so much attention to looking for |Illsbane that he/she|
almost misses the ominous circle of mushrooms. He/she| says a prayer of thanks
that he/she| noticed it before stepping inside.
================================================================================
|Susie starts to notice that it is growing brighter. He/she| looks around and
sees an unnaturally glowing clearing in the distance. He/she| feels drawn to it,
but he/she| knows that no good could possibly come to him/her| there, so he/she|
summons his/her| will and turns away from it.
================================================================================
|Susie's candle goes out; the resulting darkness is oppressive. Fortunately,
he/she| prepared for this. He/she| reached into his/her| pack and drew out
flintstone, which he/she| uses to re-light the candle.
================================================================================
|Susie can feel that something is amiss, but he/she| can't figure out what. He/she|
pauses for a moment and looks around. After a moment, he/she| realizes that
his/her| shadow didn't stop walking when he/she| did. He/she| backs away slowly as
his/her| shadow gets further and further away from him/her|. He/she| decide to
start searching in a different direction.
================================================================================
|Susie looks up at the Moon. For reasons that nobody understands, the Moon is
always full in the Wicked Forest. The good news is that this makes it easier to
search for |Illsbane, but the bad news is that he/she| has to worry about
werewolves...
================================================================================
“Hello, human. It isn't often that I get to see one of your kind here.”

|Susie jumped and looked around for the source of the voice. He/she| heard it
laugh. “You are just as stupid as the rest of your kind. Look, I am over here.”

|Susie finally realized that the voice was coming from the tree right next to
her.

“Why are you here?” it asked. |Susie replied, “I am looking for an |Illsbane
plant. I down't suppose you have seen one?” It laughed. “Do I look like I have
legs?” |Susie replied, “Umm, no, I guess not; I guess I'll just be going on my
way then...”

|Susie resumed searching, the laugher of the tree receding as he/she| left it
behind.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

found_stories ∷ [SubEvent]
found_stories = [s|
After searching for what feels like hours, |Susie nearly steps on an |Illsbane
plant. his/her| heart leaps and he/she| gives a short prayer of thanks. He/she|
reaches down carefully to pick it up, and then starts heading back to his/her|
home.
================================================================================
|Susie starts to hear a sound and he/she| can't tell whether it is a buzzing or
the most beautiful music he/she| has ever heard. As it gets louder he/she|
notices the area around him/her| starting to get brighter. He/she| looks around
and sees a fairy, glowing brightly in the dark. The fairy beckons to him/her|,
and then flies away. |Susie hesitates briefly, and then runs after the fairy.

|Susie chases the fairy for about an hour, starting to doubt whether this is
such a good idea, when the fairy stops. He/she| catches up to it and sees {an
Illsbane} plant under it. Carefully, he/she| reaches down and picks it. When
he/she| looks up, the fairy is gone.

He/she| falls to his/her| knees and thanks you for guiding her to the plan.
He/she| then gets up and starts heading back to his/her| home.

|Susie is starting to feel like he/she| will never make it back when he/she|
notices that things are starting to get brighter -- he/she| must be getting close
to the vilage! he/she| gives you thanks for guiding her home.

A little bit further, and he/she| is back to his/her| house. Without a moment to
spare, he/she| immediately starts brewing medicine for |Tommy! He/she| brings
the medicine to |Tommy, and wakes him/her|Tommy up long enough to ladel it down
his throat. He/she|Tommy immediately falls back asleep. As |Susie is filled with
relief, exhaustion catches up to him/her| and he/she| falls asleep on the floor.

He/she| sleeps peacefully, with a smile on his/her| face. The next day, he/she|
builds an alter to you out of gratitude.
