After searching for what feels like hours, |Susie nearly steps on an |Illsbane
plant. his/her| heart leaps and he/she| gives a short prayer of thanks. He/she|
reaches down carefully to pick it up, and then starts heading back to his/her|
home.
================================================================================
|Susie starts to hear a sound and he/she| can't tell whether it is a buzzing or
the most beautiful music he/she| has ever heard. As it gets louder he/she|
notices the area around him/her| starting to get brighter. He/she| looks around
and sees a fairy, glowing brightly in the dark. The fairy beckons to him/her|,
and then flies away. |Susie hesitates briefly, and then runs after the fairy.

|Susie chases the fairy for about an hour, starting to doubt whether this is
such a good idea, when the fairy stops. He/she| catches up to it and sees {an
Illsbane} plant under it. Carefully, he/she| reaches down and picks it. When
he/she| looks up, the fairy is gone.

He/she| falls to his/her| knees and thanks you for guiding her to the plan.
He/she| then gets up and starts heading back to his/her| home.
